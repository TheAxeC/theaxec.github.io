ðŸŒ± If you ever feel torn between fields, take that as a sign rather than as a problem.

Interdisciplinary curiosity isnâ€™t confusion. Itâ€™s creativity.



Iâ€™ve built my career at the intersections of computer science, AI, neuroscience, and biomedical data science. Most days, Iâ€™m translating between these worlds, and itâ€™s both challenging and deeply rewarding.



Working across disciplines forces you to think differently.

You learn to see patterns others miss.

You learn to collaborate with people who speak entirely different technical and scientific languages.

And you build a skill set that stands out on paper and in practice.



My advice to early-career researchers and professionals: follow your curiosity across boundaries.



Go deep enough to have expertise, but stay open enough to connect ideas between fields.



It takes more effort, but it pays off in perspective, creativity, and opportunities you canâ€™t find by staying in one lane. The bridges you build between disciplines are what the future will stand on. ðŸŒ‰
