Excited to be heading to FLTA 2025 (3rd International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications)! ðŸŽ¤
I'll be presenting work on extending Block-Term Tensor Regression to federated settings for privacy-preserving analysis of biomedical data, specifically brain-computer interfaces and clinical risk prediction.
But honestly, what I'm most looking forward to is the conversations ðŸ’¬
Federated learning sits at this fascinating intersection of machine learning, privacy, healthcare regulation, and real-world deployment challenges. The technical problems are interesting, but the implementation realities, data governance, institutional barriers, clinical workflows, are where the real challenges live.
If you're at FLTA25 and working on:

Privacy-preserving ML in healthcare
Federated learning for biomedical applications
Brain-computer interfaces
Or just curious about tensor methods in FL

Let's grab coffee â˜• or chat between sessions. I'd love to hear what problems you're tackling and what's actually working (or not working) in practice.
See you there! ðŸš€
