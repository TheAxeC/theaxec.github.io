Excited to be heading to FLTA 2025 (3rd International Conference on Federated Learning Technologies and Applications)! 🎤
I'll be presenting work on extending Block-Term Tensor Regression to federated settings for privacy-preserving analysis of biomedical data—specifically brain-computer interfaces and clinical risk prediction.
But honestly, what I'm most looking forward to is the conversations 💬
Federated learning sits at this fascinating intersection of machine learning, privacy, healthcare regulation, and real-world deployment challenges. The technical problems are interesting, but the implementation realities—data governance, institutional barriers, clinical workflows—are where the real challenges live.
If you're at FLTA25 and working on:

Privacy-preserving ML in healthcare
Federated learning for biomedical applications
Brain-computer interfaces
Or just curious about tensor methods in FL

Let's grab coffee ☕ or chat between sessions. I'd love to hear what problems you're tackling and what's actually working (or not working) in practice.
See you there! 🚀
