ðŸ’¡ Researchers aren't needed to solve easy problems.

That line hit me.

It's a reminder of what research really is â€” not about chasing what's simple or safe, but about opening paths that have never been opened before.

In science, AI, and interdisciplinary work, progress often means facing uncertainty, frustration, and failure.
But that's the point.
If it were easy, it wouldn't be research.

So to anyone struggling through the complexity of a tough project: keep going.
The fact that it's hard means you're probably working on something that matters.

Our role is to explore the unknown and build what doesn't exist yet.
That's where real discovery lives. ðŸ”¬
