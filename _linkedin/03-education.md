Federated learning isn’t just about moving models instead of data.
It’s about trust. 🤝

We often talk about the “privacy” side — keeping data local — but in healthcare, that’s just the starting point.
The real challenge is convincing hospitals, researchers, and regulators that collaboration is safe, fair, and worthwhile.

In practice, most of the hard problems are social and organizational, not purely technical:

Who owns the model?

Who’s responsible when it fails?

How do we make results reproducible when the data never leave the site?

I think the next big advances in federated learning won’t come from new algorithms but from better frameworks for governance, transparency, and accountability.

What’s your take — is federated learning more a technical innovation or a cultural shift?
