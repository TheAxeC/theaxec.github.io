# Bullet Journal

## How to Use It

Bullet journaling is a method of organizing tasks, events, and notes in a single notebook using a specific system of symbols and structures. Here's a simple breakdown. In summary, bullet journaling is a flexible and customizable way to keep track of your life, using simple symbols and logs to organize tasks, events, and notes in a clear and structured manner.

1. **Index**: Start by creating an index to keep track of where each section is in your journal.
2. **Future Log**: List out future events and tasks that aren't tied to a specific month.
3. **Monthly Log**: For each month, create a calendar section for events and a task section for things you want to accomplish.
4. **Daily Log**: Each day, list your tasks, events, and notes. Use symbols to categorize them:
   - Events: `- (o)`
   - Notes: `- (-)` (?, !)
   - Tasks: `- [ ]`
   - Completed Tasks: `- [x]`
   - Migrated Tasks: `- [>]`
   - Migrated Tasks: `- [<]`
   
5. **Collections**: Group related information into collections, like books to read or project plans.
