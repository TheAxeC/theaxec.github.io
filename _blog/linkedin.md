# Finding Rhythm in Academic Communication: One Post at a Time

A few weeks ago, I made a personal commitment: to bring a bit more structure and intention to how I share my academic journey online.

Between research deadlines, teaching, grant writing, and supervision, social media can easily feel like noise. But over the past months, I've realized that platforms like LinkedIn can also be powerful spaces for reflection, connection, and visibility — not just for “self-promotion,” but for showing what research actually looks like from the inside.

So, I decided to adopt a simple rhythm: **one post per week, four themes that repeat every month.**

---

## Week 1: Reflection and honesty

Academia can be intense. My first post in this new rhythm was a candid reflection on exhaustion, perfectionism, and the importance of mentorship. It wasn't meant to be polished or strategic — just honest.

The response reminded me how many people quietly feel the same way. Writing about the mental load of research opened a space for conversation and empathy. That's something I want to keep nurturing.

---

## Week 2: Behind the research

Next week I'll share my excitement for the **Federated Learning Technologies and Applications (FLTA 2025)** conference, where I'll present work on extending Block-Term Tensor Regression to federated settings for privacy-preserving biomedical analysis.

These posts are a chance to bring people closer to the science itself — not just the results, but the questions, collaborations, and messy problem-solving that happen along the way.

---

## Week 3: Thought leadership and curiosity

Some weeks, I'll focus on unpacking a concept that matters to my field. For example:

> Federated learning isn't just about moving models instead of data — it's about trust.

Posts like that give me space to think out loud, explain complex ideas in plain language, and invite others to share their perspectives. They're less about outreach and more about *conversation*.

---

## Week 4: Mentorship and community

Science doesn't happen in isolation. Many of my most meaningful moments come from teaching and mentoring — helping students turn complexity into clarity.

Dedicating one post a month to that theme keeps me grounded. It's a reminder that our impact often lies in how we support others, not just in what we publish.

---

## Why this rhythm matters

Posting once a week isn't about chasing engagement metrics. It's about building a sustainable, authentic habit of communication — one that reflects the real rhythm of academic life: thinking, creating, sharing, and learning.

By alternating between personal reflection, research updates, conceptual deep dives, and community focus, I can show the *whole picture* of being a researcher — the science, the struggle, and the people behind it.

If you're also trying to find your balance between research and communication, maybe this kind of rhythm could help. One post a week is enough to stay connected without burning out.

📢 I'll keep experimenting with this format over the coming months, starting with my FLTA 2025 post next week. If you're curious about federated learning, healthcare AI, or the realities of academic life, you can follow along on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axelfaes).
