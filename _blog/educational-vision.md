### Educational Vision of Axel Faes

#### Vision for Educational Impact 

I envision a future where education in computational neuroscience and AI is accessible, engaging, and impactful. I aim to:

- **Inspire Future Researchers**: By mentoring students and conducting educational workshops, I seek to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers to pursue innovative research in neurotechnology.
- **Promote Interdisciplinary Learning**: My work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, combining insights from neuroscience, engineering, and computer science to solve complex problems. I aim to foster a learning environment that encourages such cross-disciplinary collaborations.
- **Develop Educational Resources**: Through my publications, open-source projects, and potential future textbooks or online courses, I plan to provide comprehensive resources that make advanced topics in AI and neurotechnology more accessible to learners worldwide.
- **Become a bridge between data scientists and biomedical scientists**
In summary, my educational background and contributions reflect my dedication to advancing knowledge and inspiring future generations in the fields of AI, machine learning, and neurotechnology. My work not only pushes the boundaries of research but also serves as a foundation for educational excellence and innovation.


#### Educational Background
I have a robust educational foundation in computer science and artificial intelligence, which has significantly shaped my research trajectory. My academic journey includes:

1. **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** from UHasselt, where I developed foundational knowledge in computing, algorithms, and software engineering. My bachelor's thesis focused on the application of machine learning techniques for network intrusion detection systems, showcasing my early interest in practical applications of AI.

2. **Master of Science in Engineering: Computer Science** from KU Leuven. During my master's, I delved deeper into advanced computational methods and their applications. My master's thesis on algebraic subtyping for algebraic effects and handlers indicates a strong inclination towards formal methods and their optimization.

3. **Advanced Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence: Engineering & Computer Science** from KU Leuven. This advanced degree further honed my expertise in AI, culminating in a thesis that employed information-theoretical approaches to EEG source-reconstructed connectivity, bridging the gap between theoretical AI and practical neuroscience applications.

4. **PhD in Biomedical Sciences in the Department of Neuroscience** from KU Leuven. During my PhD, I further developed my research interests into neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces.

#### Educational Contributions

I am committed to education and knowledge dissemination in various capacities:

1. **Mentorship**:
   - As a (post)doctoral researcher, I have been involved in mentoring students and junior researchers, guiding them through complex projects and helping them navigate the intricacies of computational neuroscience and AI. In total, I have supervised 10 students.
   - I'm currently mentoring 3 master thesis students from the Master Informatica, Faculteit Wetenschappen. There are only 16 students from this Master currently pursuing a thesis, thus my topics (and research) have been particularly among the students.
   - My academic roles have probably included teaching assistantships or guest lectures, where I shared his expertise in machine learning, neural decoding, and computational methods with students.
   - Within BIOMED, I'm involed with the initiative to "Increase Data Science capabilities PhD students Biomedical Sciences".

2. **Workshops and Seminars**:
   - I have participated in and organized workshops and seminars aimed at educating peers and students about the latest advancements in neurotechnology and AI. I was Guest Associate Editor 2024-2025 of "Use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in Multiple Sclerosis" in Frontiers in Immunology 2024

3. **Publications and Open-source Contributions**:
   - My publications in leading journals and conferences serve as valuable educational resources for students and researchers in the field. These works provide insights into cutting-edge research methodologies and findings.
   - My GitHub repositories, including those from my theses and research projects, offer open-source tools and frameworks that can be used for educational purposes. These repositories not only demonstrate my research but also provide practical examples and code for students to learn from and build upon.

4. **Basis Kwalificatie Onderwijs**
   In 2024, I started my BKO at the UHasselt.

5. **Lecturing**
   I am co-lecturer (co-titularis) of Bio-informatica (3740).
