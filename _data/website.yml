    **Vision for Research Impact** <a href="research">(view more <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i>)</a>
    I envision a future where `biomedical data science`, `machine learning`, and `artificial intelligence` are leveraged to revolutionize healthcare. I aim to:
    - **Innovate in Health Data Analysis**: By developing innovative methods for analyzing and interpreting `complex health data`, I seek to advance the field of `precision medicine` and improve patient outcomes.
    - **Advance Brain-Computer Interfaces**: My work focuses on the understanding and application of `brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)` and neural decoding, aiming to enhance the interface between technology and neural activity.
    - **Bridge Research and Practice**: By combining expertise in `data science`, `engineering`, and `medicine`, I aim to bridge the gap between `theoretical` research and `practical` implementations, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective and personalized healthcare solutions.

      **Vision for Educational Impact**
      I envision a future where education in `biomedical data science` and `AI` is accessible, engaging, and impactful. I aim to:
      - **Inspire Future Researchers**: By mentoring students and conducting educational workshops,  have successfully supervised over a dozen Master Thesis students in the field of `AI`, `Statistics & Data Science`, `Computer Science` and `Biomedical Science`.
      - **Promote Interdisciplinary Learning**: I am currently working to obtain my `BKO` (Basis Kwalificatie Onderwijs) from the UHasselt and aim to foster a learning environment that encourages cross-disciplinary collaborations. I teach `Brain-Computer Interfaces`, `Federated Learning`, and `Bioinformatics`.
      - **Develop Educational Resources**: Through my publications and `open-source projects` I plan to provide comprehensive resources that make advanced topics in AI and biomedical data science more accessible to learners worldwide.
